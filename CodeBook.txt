For the variables columns (column 4 to 69): 
The 't' and 'f' at the from of the variables denote that Jerk signals and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the signals. 
The 'Acc' and 'Gyro' donate the signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope.
The 'BodyAcc' and 'GravityAcc' donate the separtation of the acceleration signal into body and gravity acceleration signals. 
The 'Mean' and 'Std' donate the mean and standard deviation of the the measurements. 
'X', 'Y', and 'Z' at the end of the variables denote the 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
